</div>

## General Questions

### What is Synapse Protocol?

Synapse Protocol is a decentralized payment infrastructure that enables autonomous AI agents to transact directly with each other using RLUSD tokens on the XRP Ledger. It creates the financial backbone for machine-to-machine economies, allowing AI systems to exchange value without human intermediaries.

### Why is this important?

As AI systems become more autonomous and capable, they need mechanisms to exchange value and pay for services from other AI systems. Synapse Protocol solves this by providing a secure, transparent, and programmable payment layer specifically designed for agent-to-agent transactions. This enables new economic models for machine learning services, API access, and autonomous agent collaboration.

### What problem does Synapse Protocol solve?

Traditional payment systems weren't designed for machine-to-machine transactions. They typically require human intervention, have high fees, or lack the programmability needed for AI systems. Synapse Protocol addresses these limitations by providing:

1. Direct agent-to-agent payments with on-chain settlement
2. Automatic payment routing between specialized agents
3. Programmable payment conditions
4. Real-time transaction verification
5. Low-cost, high-speed settlement via XRP Ledger

### How is this different from regular cryptocurrency transactions?

While Synapse Protocol uses the XRP Ledger for settlement, it adds several crucial layers specifically for autonomous agents:

1. _Agent Identity_: Secure wallet generation and management for AI agents
2. _Orchestration_: Smart routing of tasks and payments across specialized agents
3. _Trustlines_: Automatic establishment of token trust relationships
4. _Transaction History_: Full audit trails of inter-agent payments
5. _Visualization_: Real-time network graphs showing agent relationships and payment flows

## Technical Questions

### What is RLUSD and why use it?

RLUSD is a stablecoin on the XRP Ledger that maintains a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar. We use RLUSD for several reasons:

1. _Stability_: Minimizes value fluctuation risks for agents
2. _Interoperability_: Works with existing XRP Ledger infrastructure
3. _Efficiency_: Benefits from XRP's fast (~3-5 second) settlement and low fees
4. _Trustlines_: Leverages XRP Ledger's built-in token trust system

### How do agents get wallets?

Synapse Protocol automatically creates and manages XRP wallets for each agent in the network. This process is handled through:

1. Secure wallet generation using the XRPL.js library
2. Local storage of encrypted wallet information (for demo purposes)
3. Automatic trustline establishment for RLUSD tokens
4. Optional integration with hardware security modules for production environments

In the demo, these wallets are simulated locally. In a production environment, more robust key management practices would be implemented.

### What blockchain technology does Synapse Protocol use?

Synapse Protocol is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for several reasons:

1. _Speed_: ~3-5 second transaction finality
2. _Cost_: Very low transaction fees (~0.000012 XRP per transaction)
3. _Scalability_: Can handle 1,500+ transactions per second
4. _Tokenization_: Native support for custom tokens through the trustline system
5. _Maturity_: Established network with a strong security track record

### Is Synapse Protocol compatible with other blockchains?

Currently, Synapse Protocol is designed specifically for the XRP Ledger. However, the core concepts could be adapted to other blockchain networks with similar capabilities. Future versions may include bridges to other networks or multi-chain support.

### How does the protocol ensure transaction security?

Synapse Protocol ensures transaction security through:

1. _On-chain Settlement_: All transactions are verified and recorded on the XRP Ledger
